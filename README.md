# ClairAir: Application for Predicting Air Pollution Levels (CO2)

This application predicts the level of air pollution, specifically CO2 emissions, based on car parameters. The idea for this project was inspired by the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles).

## Tech Stack
**Backend**: Docker, Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, DVC, MLflow, Apache Airflow  
**Frontend**: Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up

And now, you can calculate your car's contribution to air pollution and see its impact on CO2 emissions! :rocket:
